# To-Do List (Terminal Based, Python)
Allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. Tasks are stored in two formats: a code-formatted file for program use and a human-readable file for easy viewing. Each task includes a description, times, deadline, priority, category, and status. It highlights approaching deadlines and overdue tasks.

## Features

- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks by updating their details.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Save Tasks**: Tasks are saved in both code-formatted and human-readable files for persistence.
