# To-Do List (Terminal-based, Python)

Allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.

It highlights approaching deadlines and overdue tasks.

- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks with their details, including approaching deadlines and overdue tasks.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks by updating their details.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Save Tasks**: Tasks are saved in both code-formatted and human-readable files for persistence.
- **Deadline Alerts**: Automatically highlights tasks with approaching deadlines or overdue tasks.
